## The History of Electric Organs
 
Electric organs have a long and fascinating history that dates back to the late 19th century. The first attempts to create an electric organ were made by inventors who wanted to use electricity to enhance or replace the pipes of a traditional organ. One of the earliest examples was the Telharmonium, a massive and complex instrument that used rotating electromagnetic tone-wheels to generate sound. It was invented by Thaddeus Cahill in 1897 and was exhibited in Massachusetts and New York in 1906, but it was too expensive and impractical to become widely popular.

In the 1920s and 1930s, several electronic organs were developed that used electronic oscillators to produce tones. These oscillators were circuits that carried an alternating current at a specific frequency, which could be varied for different pitches. One of the first successful electronic organs was created by Edouard Coupleux and Armand Givelet in France in 1928. It used electronic oscillators instead of pipes and was operated with keyboards and a pedal board. Another notable electronic organ was the Rangertone, invented by Richard H. Ranger in the United States in 1931. It used vacuum tubes to amplify the sound of metal reeds.
 
## The Hammond Organ and Beyond
 
One of the most important and well-known electric organs was the Hammond organ, invented by Laurens Hammond in 1934. Unlike most other electric organs, it used a complex set of rotary, motor-driven generators to produce sound. These generators were called tonewheels and they spun past electromagnetic pickups to create electrical signals. The Hammond organ also had a series of controls that affected the harmonics, or component tones, of the sound, creating a variety of timbres that could imitate other instruments or create unique effects. The Hammond organ also featured a rotating speaker cabinet called a Leslie, which added a distinctive modulation and vibrato to the sound.
 
The Hammond organ became very popular in jazz, rock, soul, funk and gospel music, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. Some of the most famous Hammond organ players include Jimmy Smith, Booker T. Jones, Keith Emerson, Jon Lord and Rick Wakeman. The Hammond organ also influenced the development of other types of electric organs, such as combo organs, home organs and software organs. Combo organs were small and portable organs that were popular in rock bands in the 1960s and 1970s. They often had transistor-based circuits and bright sounds. Some examples are the Vox Continental, the Farfisa Compact and the Gibson G-101. Home organs were designed for domestic use and often had built-in rhythm machines and accompaniment features. They were popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Some examples are the Lowrey Organ, the Wurlitzer Organ and the Yamaha Electone. Software organs are computer programs that simulate the sound and function of electric organs. They can be played with MIDI keyboards or controllers and offer a high level of realism and flexibility. Some examples are Native Instruments B4, Arturia B-3 V and Logic Pro Vintage B3.
